Files tied to the Cogit project for creating a shared language of thought


This repo has both the text (as in book) and the development files for a language of thought that can be
used for collaborative content creation.
This branch tries to expand on the core flow of thought by adding thought towards augment self awereness learning and collaboration through audio video and structured context and providing examples of modules that cater to specifics within a social exchange system.
