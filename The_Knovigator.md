## The Knovigator
Let me start with the end goal: the knovitagor. The knovigator should make learning as simple as walking or running, so that education gets integrated deeply into the way we live "naturally."

## Oral Knowledge

The traditional Indian education system was primarily oral. Texts were written down on palm leaves and re-transcribed, but for the most part learning involved memorization of a vast array of texts, so that a substantial portion of the learner's tradition was available instantly. This is not unique to the Indian tradition, the Greek tradition was also similar. Socrates famously distrusted the writing down of ideas. While we think of these oral practices as quaint, or even worse, emphasizing rote learning over conceptual understanding, there are good cognitive reasons underlying these practices. 

For one, the emphasis on explicit and error free memorization means that the traditions' knowledge is explicitly, consciously shared among the entire community of learners. That's always useful and leads to exceptionally good training. In modern learning, the only place I know where similar practices are followed is in theoretical physics and in mathematics, where you could argue that all researchers share an identical (OK, maybe that's too strong) understanding of the basic principles of the subject. It's a lot easier to settle disputes and arguments if we start from the same assumptions. A house built on a solid foundation is much more stable -- while we might laugh at the longevity of these ancient traditions and think of them as outmoded relics, that stable foundation leads to exceptionally robust knowledge. It's not surprising that physics and mathematics are the subtlest of the sciences (am I betraying my biases here?). 

Second, it means that by the time the novice becomes an expert (s)he has an explicit cognitive map of the tradition as a whole. Knowledge and skill merge into an extended mind that makes learning *natural*; because these traditions didn't have access to print technology, they had to rely on extending the capacities of their own minds and brains. That's a good thing. In many ways print technology took us away from our biological inheritance. More on cognitive extension later. 

Third, and most importantly, these traditions emphasize the person over the text. Socrates is world famous without ever putting a word down on paper; the reason is because Socrates the man is more important to us than Socrates the writer. Knowledge resides in people rather than in books. It's very hard for us to appreciate that difference - we have an exceptionally abstracted view of knowledge. However, in the times we live in, where information and knowledge are changing daily, texts cannot adapt, but people can and will. If we shift our educational goals from making texts to **making people**, we will have accomplished an immensely important and necessary shift for the complex world of the 21st century. How can we do so and what role can technology play in that shift?

## "Artificial Intelligence"

Let me put it another way: what we mean by intelligence is almost entirely "artificial intelligence," because almost everything we take to be a demonstration of intelligence comes from culture rather than nature. 

OK, I am not saying that nature and culture are two different things altogether, but I hope you get my point: whether it is learning mathematics or reading or writing, almost everything we consider to be a core skill or a universal educational outcome is "unnatural" in the sense that we don't develop those skills on our own in the natural course of human development.

## Natural and Artificial 

Of course, that's the whole point of education isn't it? To go beyond what nature and biology has given us? If the only knowledge we know is what we get from our natural developmental course, we won't have rockets and transistors or, opera's for that matter. 

So there's a tension: on the one hand, we want to make education and learning as natural as possible, but at the same time, we want our education to go beyond (while building upon) our biological endowment. 

That's the challenge: 

* How to build upon our biology?
* How to integrate our understanding of biology into our learning engines?
* How to redesign education from the ground up using our rapidly increasing knowledge of our biological capacities for learning?
